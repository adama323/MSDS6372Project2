#### Before keeping the train/test split it came with, check out if training set has covered all the levels for test set
Category workclass, education, marital.status, occupation, relationship, race, native.country all need to be checked 

**By Observing the given split below, all levels have been careful split to make sure all test set levels has been included in training set, and it looks like the split ratio is about 2:1 between train and test set. Decided to keep such split and proceed EDA on training set to prevent bias towards test set**

**Since the NA values only exist on occupation, workclass, and native.country, it make sense to keep them as Not Known instead of simply deleting them since there might be some common features among the Not Known categories to make the prediction more accurate - if they turn out to be outliers instead, we can always (went back to previous code chunk to rerun it to "Not Known" instead.)**

```{r}
summary(adult$workclass)
summary(adult.test$workclass)
# By Looking at workclass - it doesn't seem to have any level issues

summary(adult$education)
summary(adult.test$education)
# By Looking at education column - it doesn't seem to have any level issues

summary(adult$marital.status)
summary(adult.test$marital.status)
# By Looking at marital.status column - it doesn't seem to have any level issues

#### EDA on Training dataset - adult (initial inspection and correlation between predictors)
1. marital.status and relationship are correlated with each other - By looking at table marital.status vs relationship - their interaction can be potentially interesting in explaining a specific situation - might be interesting to explore as an interaction term
2. education.num and education are perfectly correlated with each other - education.num is probably directly derived from education level
3. Due to the fact missing values between workclass and occupation are almost identical and they seem to both contribute to predicting response variable (income), so decision is made to delete missing values in these two observations to preserve the ability to use both variables.
4. After identifying the correlation between the response above, by fitting a lm model for the remaining predictors, GVIF is no longer an issue

```{r}
library(GGally)
# education, occupation, and native-country have 15 levels or more - these levels need to be explored individually
# ggpairs(adult,columns=c(1,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13),aes(colour=income))
# Comment out due to large run time. See image folder pairsplot1.png
# Blue is >50k, Orange <=50k
# Some workclass, marital.status, relationship, race, sex might be helpful for predicting income based on initial pairs plot

#create temp variable in order to fit lm model to test vif
temp = as.numeric(adult$income)
linear.model = lm(temp~.-income-education.num-occupation,data=adult)

library(car) # where vif lives
summary(linear.model)
vif(linear.model)

# See above result. Since occupation and education.num are creating aliased coefficients in the model they were removed from the  model first
# By looking at the rest of the predictors marital.status has GVIF of 63.54, and relationship has GVIF of 79.49 - these can potentiall have multicollinearity problems

# remove relationship variable see if GVIF gets better
linear.model1 = lm(temp~.-income-education.num-occupation-relationship,data=adult)
vif(linear.model1)

table(marital.status,relationship)
# Although by looking at the table above. It seems Marital status can be helpful in explaining status of a specific relationship status
# So even GVIF is high with them both present, their interaction can be helpful to make a better model

# looks like after relationship is removed marital.status becomes a lot better
# so marital.status and relationship are correlated with each other which also make intuitive sense

# Which variable is more associated with the response though? - try chi-squared test approximation(since dataset is quite large)
attach(adult)
chi.test <- chisq.test(table(income,marital.status))
chi.test
# Extremely small p-value < 2.2e-16 - marital.status and income are strongly associated

chi.test1 <- chisq.test(table(income,relationship))
chi.test1
# About the same levels of association
summary(marital.status)
summary(relationship)
# Can potentially explore either marital.status and relationship to see which one produce better prediction

# Note education.num and education may also be strongly correlated
plot(education.num~education)
# As we can see education.num and education are perfectly correlated with each other - education.num is probably directly derived from education level
# Although the actual education category doesn't assume equal distance between levels - it might be a better predictor overall

# Try getting rid of relationship and education.num and see if occupation is still an issue with GVIF

#### EDA on Training dataset - adult (continue)
1. Based on the Pairs plot between principle components, there seem to have some seperation between two response levels under PC1 and PC2, PC1 and PC3, PC2 and PC3 seem to have more like a QDA relationship(QDA might run better)
2. Although there seem to be some seperation, this seperation doesn't seem to be particularly satisfying - so using continuous variables along may not lead to great prediction
3. Age and marital.status may have some interaction see below.
4. We didn't find any highly correlated continous variables

```{r}
# It will be interesting to first perform a PCA and look at how numeric variables can contribute to predicting the response

# seems capital.gain > 1st Qu, it is mostly over 50k income group

# This inspires us to create a indicator variable to improve accuracy rate

plot(capital.loss~income,col=c("red","blue")) #similar to capital gain most values are around 0
# However values that is not 0 seem to converge to similar mean - so it doesn't looks as helpful to us as a predictor

#### Objective 2 Part 2 - Create competing model using continuous predictors and use LDA or QDA
LDA model is the winner after comparison:
Even QDA have slightly better AUC value(suspect QDA is overfit) - the cut off of probability is extremely sensitive(highly dependent on test set)
Thus LDA is the winner
However, LDA performance isn't as good compared to Logistic Regression

```{r}
# construct the LDA model
# Fron EDA we know fnlwgt is not helpful in identifying income - will not use it here
# We will use education.num since it is a substitute for education
mylda <- lda(income ~ age + education.num+ capital.gain+capital.loss+hours.per.week, data = adult)
mylda.prd <- predict(mylda, newdata = adult.test)
mylda.posterior <- mylda.prd$posterior[,2]

# Generate ROC curve to find a cutoff to use
results.lda <-prediction(mylda.posterior, adult.test$income,label.ordering=c("<=50K.",">50K."))
roc.lda = performance(results.lda, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
plot(roc.lda,colorize = TRUE)
abline(a=0, b= 1)
auc.lda <- performance(results.lda, measure = "auc")
auc.lda <- auc.lda@y.values
text(x = .40, y = .6,paste("AUC = ", round(auc.lda[[1]],3), sep = ""))
# As we can see the lda model is slighly less good compared to logistic regression model
# The ROC curve has shifted downwards compared to LR - AUC =0.809(decreased)
# Nevertheless to balance off performance between high True positive and low False positive we can use around 0.25

#Calculate logistic regression complex using cut of 0.25 on test set
cutoff1<-0.23
class.lda <-factor(ifelse(mylda.posterior>cutoff1,">50K.","<=50K."),levels=c("<=50K.",">50K."))
confusionMatrix(class.lda,adult.test$income)
# Accuracy : Accuracy : 0.726  Sensitivity : 0.7263 Specificity : 0.7251

#### Objective 2 part 3 - Nonparametric model approach - Random forest
- Default RF ntree = 500 and m variables =sqrt(p) seem to work better than ntree=100
- Try iterate through mtry variable from 1 to 10 using prediction cut off previously discovered - seems mtry = 1 works best on overall accuracy
- After actually fitting random forest with mtry = 1 the AUC = 0.882 (performance is worse compare to default mtry=3). Sensitivity and Specificity also suffers after adjusting the cut off. So Default RF option still wins!
- So Mtry = 3 seems to be the perfect balance for our dataset in order to provide good AUC.
- We further added in calculations for AUC under each mtry #, and it also tells us mtry=3 provides the best AUC value
